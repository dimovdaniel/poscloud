We post the updated file publicly. And you can download the updates from [here](http://updates.restoqr.online/v2/).

Go inside your current version. There should be a zip file. If the zip file version, is bigger than current, there is an update for that version.

Download the zip file and extract it locally.

Connect to your FTP, and navigate to the root of it.

Drag and Drop the folders from the update to your FTP. Overwrite them.

## Error 500 on migrating languages

**Problem**\
Before, 2.0.8 if you try to migrate language you can get an error 500. And some of the items like the categories can be translated multiple times like `{en:\\\en:\\\......}`

**Reason**\
This happens because we didn't look into object active status. And script crashed when it tried to translate an un-active record.

**Solution**\
Update to 2.0.8+ For the`{en:\\\en:\\\......}`, if you don't have a lot of data, you can manually edit them from the admin. If you have a lot of data,

* Export the categories and items table
* Find replace, so it looks normal
*   Delete categories and items by ignoring foreign keys and import again

    Or ask for help from us.

Then make the translation migration again. Now should go fine.

## Error on uploading an image

**Error**

"PHP Fileinfo extension must be installed

**Reason**\
"PHP Fileinfo extension must be installed/enabled to use Intervention Image."

The project needs the [fileinfo](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhN3E.png) extension.

**Solution**

As you can see on the [image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhN3E.png), it can be enabled from PHP Selector. But if there is no PHP Selector you should have access to **WHM**.

**IN WHM**

Initially, we login to WHM and navigate as follows,

Software >> EasyApache 4 >> Customize >> PHP extensions.

Here we search for **fileinfo** and enable phpx.x-php-fileinfo for all versions. Finally, we click on Review and Provision.

This enables the file extension for all the PHP websites in the server.

Let me know about this.
