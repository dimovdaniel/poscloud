# Mail server

## Why I need it

You will need to have SMTP \( way to send mail \) because the system will use it to

* Send password reset email
* Order related notifications 
* Restaurant owner registration
* Driver registration

#### SMTP from shared hosting

This is probably the easiest way to obtain SMTP data. Create an email in your hosting and get a note of the credentials. You will need them in the install process.

Then click on "Connect Device". You will find all the required info there
