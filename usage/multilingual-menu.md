# Multilingual menu

In order to enable multilingual menu first you will need to support more than one languages on your website.

If you didn't done that please check this [article](https://mobidonia.gitbook.io/qr-menu-maker/usage/translations#how-to-add-a-new-language). This step is a must.

Next step is to enable the added language as a supported language in the website configuration. Check this [article](https://mobidonia.gitbook.io/qr-menu-maker/usage/translations#add-language-on-the-front-page).

When you've done with this configuration open the Settings page \(Setup\) and enable the option **Enable multi language menus** and save the changes.

Now on top of the settings page you will see the option for making the all restaurant's menus in the website's default language. Click on the red button.
