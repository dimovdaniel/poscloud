# Multilingual menu

In order to enable multilingual menu first you will need to support more than one languages on your website.

If you didn't done that please check this [article](https://mobidonia.gitbook.io/qr-menu-maker/usage/translations#how-to-add-a-new-language). This step is a must.

Next step is to enable the added language as a supported language in the website configuration. Check this [article](https://mobidonia.gitbook.io/qr-menu-maker/usage/translations#add-language-on-the-front-page).

When you've done with this configuration open the Settings page \(Setup\) and enable the option **Enable multi language menus** and save the changes.
