# Getting Started

## User roles <a id="41-user-roles"></a>

This project supports two different roles for user account **admin** and **owner**. One user account can't be all roles.

An **admin** is responsible for:

* Manage restaurants
* Manage pages
* Manage application settings

An **owner** can actually work with the restaurant:

* Manage own restaurant
* Manage restaurant menu
* Manage Staff
* Manage Expenses
* Manage floor plan

A **staff -** waiter can actually work with the ordering process:

* Manage own orders
* Take new orders
